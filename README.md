# nfaber_varroa_gd

This git repository contains the code used to model gene drives in a Varroa mite population. The code was written for the work described in Faber et al. (2021) and is provided for reproducibility and further research. The code was run with R 4.0.5 and AlphaSimR 1.0.1.

To run the code: First make sure R and all packages are installed. Then, clone the git repository, change the working directories in the Fig<>.R files run!
